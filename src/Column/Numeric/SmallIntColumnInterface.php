/**
 * A representation of the SMALLINT SQL column.
 *
 * The number in the bracket in int(N) is often confused by the maximum size allowed for the column,
 * as it does in the case of varchar(N).
 * But this is not the case with Integer data types - the number N
 * in the bracket is not the maximum size for the column,
 * but simply a parameter to tell MySQL what width to display the column at when
 * the table’s data is being viewed via the MySQL console
 * (when you’re using the ZEROFILL attribute).
 *
 * An SMALLINT will always be 2 bytes (16 bit) no matter what length is specified.
 * Signed value is: -2^(16-1) to 0 to 2^(16-1)-1 = -32768 to 0 to 32767. One bit is for sign.
 * Unsigned values is: 0 to 2^16-1 = 0 to 65535
